(self.CBRNE)submitted 16 days ago by Kingjmasta450Ive seen a lot of contradicting information online, and I am trying to find out if the JCAD can in fact detect blood agents, which model specifically, and what it actually alerts to on the machine, eg: GB, GA etc.

Nerve, blister and a TIC only. 
None of the ones I’ve used shipped with a blood agent tester but did ship with the test chemicals for the nerve and blister. 
Smith detection is the current manufacturer for the DOD for the JCAD. Give them a call on Tuesday to talk to one of their sales reps and you’ll have an answer from the source.

But that's where it stops, no further info, nothing at all specific. So I thought maybe it was a particular model or something

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]igtbk1916 1 point2 points3 points 15 days ago (2 children)I dug into JCAD detection capabilities at one point a few years ago. I don't remember the exact detail but the conclusion was that detection times and detection thresholds were so hight that it was not operationally feasible for detecting anything other than the nerve and blister role we were using it for and it was just one tool among other detectors/tools needed to get the full picture. The Air Force AFTTP document laid out the lab verified detection times and thresholds. The T.O. basically said that we would not consider it capable of TIC detection for military purposes. This was like 6 years ago last I looked though.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]Kingjmasta450[S] 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago (1 child)Thank you for the thoughtful response. I'm in a civil support team, and I was putting together a scenario for the survey section based on a particular chemical, and pay of that was how each of our pieces of equipment would, or would not be able to detect it. Kept seeing stuff online that JCAD was able to detect blood agents, but it was nothing more than that sentence. I couldn't find any type of evidence of further information on the topic.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]Vatremere 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago (0 children)Might have to rely on the decades ole' OG - The M256A1 Chemical Agent Detection Kit. Remember to wear gloves when breaking the ampules.
